# Chapter 1: What's Programming?

## 1.1 Programes and Programming

A _program_ is a set of instructions.

Defining new operations and combining them to do useful things is the heart and soul of programming.

As Professor Jeannette Wing wrote in _**Computational Thinking**_, computational thinking is about the following:

- _Conceptualizing, not programming_. Computer science isn't computer programming. Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer: it requires thinking at multiple levels of abstraction.
- _A way that humans, not computers, think._ Computational thinking is a way humans solve problems; it isn't trying to get humans to think like computers. Computers are dull and boring; humans are clever and imaginative. We humans make computers exciting. Equipped with computing devices, we use our cleverness to tackle problems we wouldn't dare take on before the age of computing and build systems with functionality limited only by our imaginations.
- _For everyone, everywhere._ Computational thinking will be a reality when it becomes so integral to human endeavors it disappears as an explicit philosophy.
