## 1.0 The Importance of NumPy

- Theoretical and Practical Information about Vectors and Matrices
- NumPy Array Operations and their Usage in Multi-Dimensional Arrays

## 1.1 Technical Requirements

- Jupyter Notebooks (http://jupyter.org/install)
- Python 3.x
- Anaconda / Miniconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Within VS Code, "Jupyter" extension (from Microsoft) can be installed

## 1.2 Why do we need NumPy?

NumPy is the most fundamental package for **scientific computing** in Python, and is the base for many other packages.

Following are some well-known libraries which use NumPy features: pyflux, TPOT, xcessiv, xgboost, mlbox, torch, opencv, lightgbm, Keras, gensim, h5py, hyperopt, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
