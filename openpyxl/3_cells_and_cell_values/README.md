## 3.1 Accessing Cell Values

Cell values are accessed using several methods.

The most common method is indexing using the cell's coordinates as a string (e.g., "A1") or using the `cell()`1 method, which takes row and column numbers, see below sample:

```python
```

Remeber - same as Excel - that cell coordinates are 1-based (the top-left cell is "A1").

An empty cell will have a `value` of `None`.
